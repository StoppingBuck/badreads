# Badreads

Badreads is a book tracking Android application for logging books
you're reading, read, and want to read. Your library "shelves" (reading, read, and to read)
are stored locally on your phone. Use the search or barcode reader to look up
new book on [OpenLibrary](https://openlibary.org) and add it to your library. You can
import and export your library from or to Open Library and Goodreads.
